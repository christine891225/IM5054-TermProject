Have you tried catching Pok?mon in recent years? This viral game that swept the world is based on technology called augmented reality (AR). The term itself was coined in 1990, and was once adopted by television and the military. With the rise of the Internet and smartphones, AR is nowadays mostly related to user-environment interaction. When you wear a device equipped with AR software 10 and a camera â€” be it a smartphone or a tablet the program analyzes the incoming video stream, and projects 3D models of relevant data or animations onto physical objects in the real world. During the past few years, various augmented reality apps have gradually remolded our habits. For the near term, the technology will enable museumgoers to conjure up guides at any time. In that case, future visitors may not need to schedule a guided tour in advance for certain exhibitions or displays. Moreover, AR can also be applied to education. Hands-on AR sandboxes allows students to create topographic models by shaping real sand and then displaying virtual contour lines. Such resources facilitate additional exhibit extensions, such as tsunami prediction, in a variety of venues. While the new tools and features are impressive, hardware limitations still pose barriers to making AR work in everyday use. Though many existing museum and travel apps that use AR to enhance an experience can be downloaded in advance, the quality of the graphics may not meet users' expectations. Nonetheless, advances in image and object recognition, along with the ubiquity of smartphone cameras, mean that improvements are constantly being made. As cheaper and faster AR-ready mobile chips become available, augmented reality will eventually join the Internet as an unexceptional part of our everyday lives.
