In the thirteenth century, the Mongol Empire stretched across the continents of Asia and Europe. Its leader, Genghis Khan, conquered cities from Beijing to Vienna by employing terrifying weapons such as catapults and burning oil. His most important piece of equipment, however, was not a weapon, but a cooking tool: a wok. Genghis and the other Mongols needed woks to prepare hot pot, their favorite dish. Since these warriors were always on the move, their cooking tools needed to be easy to carry, and their food needed to be prepared quickly. Thus, after the day's battle, warriors would throw some beef or lamb into their sizzling woks to create simple but satisfying meals. They cut the meats into very thin slices so that they would cook quickly and use less fuel. Genghis's personal hot pot was prepared using a secret recipe that called for over sixty different medicinal herbs. This meal, known as the "desert wok," gave Genghis tremendous strength and energy. But more than that, the Mongol leader believed that his nightly hot pots would allow him to live forever. While Genghis didn't achieve his ambition to be immortal, the hot pot has lived on. Mongolian influence brought hot pot to all corners of Asia, and today there are dozens of varieties of the desert wok. Koreans use kimchi to make their hot pots spicy, while the Japanese often put Kobe beef in their shabu shabu, their word for hot pot. Today, while sipping warm broth from steaming pots, we can still get a taste of the Mongol warrior's success.
