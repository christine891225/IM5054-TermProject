There was a time when Whitney didn’t have a lot of friends. She was a bit shy and reserved. She never really wanted to be popular, but she did want to have someone to share secrets and laughs with. All through high school, though, she wasn’t able to make good friends or find companionship. When it was time to go to college, Whitney was quite nervous. She was going to be rooming with someone she didn’t know and living in a town 300 miles away from home. There wouldn’t be a single person she knew in town. She had no idea how she was going to make friends in this new environment. The first week of classes, something happened that changed Whitney’s life forever. In her English Composition class, she was asked to share a little about herself. She told everyone where she came from and all of the other ordinary details that students share in such situations. The final question for each student to answer was, “what is your goal for this class?” Most of the students said that they would like to get a good grade, pass the class or something similar. For some reason, Whitney said something entirely different. She said that her goal was to make just one good friend.
While most of the students sat in silence, one student came to Whitney and held out her hand and introduced herself. She asked if they could be friends. The whole room was silent. All eyes focused on Whitney and the hand extended just in front of her. Whitney smiled and stretched her hand out and a friendship was formed. Whitney learned the power of asking for what she wanted and taking action on that day.
