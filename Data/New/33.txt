It can be hard to distinguish fact from fiction when it comes to health cures. If something seems too strange then it can be quickly dismissed. Some of these things, however, may actually have real benefits. Cinnamon has been a top flavor in desserts for ages, but research shows that this spice might protect us from dangerous bacteria. Food safety scientists have discovered that cinnamon oil can successfully kill E.coli, a toxin that causes illness when consumed. Of course, it wouldn't be practical to add it to everything we eat. In the future, it may be used in other ways, though, such as being added to the packages that meat and produce are sold in. Coffee is another thing that may be better than we think. Studies looked at the drinking habits of 1,400 people aged 65 to 79 and found that coffee consumption may lower the risk of dementia. According to the results, people who drank 3 to 5 cups a day had the lowest risk. However, don't start drinking more coffee just yet because there could be other factors involved. Also, drinking excessive amounts could cause other problems, like sleeplessness. But at least you don't need to feel guilty if you need one more cup to keep you going some days. It's not just things we eat or drink that might have extra benefits. A recent study has shown that music could affect our hearts. Researchers had volunteers listen to pieces of music with fast and slow tempos. When the tempos were quicker, the subjects experienced increased blood pressure and heart rates. Not surprisingly, slower melodies caused those rates to decrease. While this research is only beginning, there is hope that it may improve therapy for conditions like strokes.
It's always good to be cautious with health benefit claims, but sometimes things that seem unusual might really be true!
