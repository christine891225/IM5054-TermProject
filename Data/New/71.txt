Of its millions of readers worldwide, manga, or Japanese comics, seems to hold a special appeal for adolescents with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). If young adults with ASD love manga, what does their preference reveal about the way they view and process the world around them? At the most basic level, manga may appeal to adolescents with ASD simply because it is an image-rich medium, and many autistic individuals are better at processing images than words. As Temple Grandin, a prominent author and speaker on autism, observes in The Autistic Brain: Thinking Across the Spectrum, they are visual thinkers. Not all adolescents with ASD, to be sure, will possess such exceptional visuospatial skills as reproducing architectural structures from memory. But research has shown that many of them will pay more attention to small visual details than will their neurotypical peers, sometimes at the cost of the larger picture. As a medium, manga typically contains fewer words and more pictures than Western comics.  The amount of wordless passages in any volume of manga may be striking to the Western eye. To "read" manga is to read imagesâ€”the rhythm is determined by the sequence of images. In most cases, this means that the image alone conveys narrative information. The spare use of narrative captions and word bubbles in manga, combined with its reliance on picture-specific storytelling, then, may be the main reason it hooks visually oriented adolescents with ASD. Adding to this appeal, manga often features highly detailed, photorealistic illustrations of buildings as backgrounds.   The celebrated series A Distant Neighborhood by Jiro Taniguchi, for example, includes exquisite renderings of trains and train stations that adolescents with ASD may find captivating.
