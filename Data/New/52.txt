The Kanji of the Year selection is an annual event in Japan. Each December, one kanji, or written character, is chosen by members of the Japanese Kanji Proficiency Society to represent the year that has passed. The poll has been conducted by the society since 1995. Part of the event involves the head monk of a famous temple in Kyoto writing the choice out with traditional brush and ink. The monk was far from enthusiastic about 2007's choice, however. It was nise, which means "fake" in Japanese. But even if nise hadn't won out, he would probably have been no happier about having to write the runners-up. These included the kanji for "lie" and "suspicion." The choice of such negative-meaning kanji reflected public outrage over a series of scandals. One of these involved corrupt cabinet ministers while another centered on food companies using "fake" production dates. Happily, the 2008 Kanji of the Year, hen, meaning "change," reflected a slightly more positive attitude. One of the main influences on its selection was the election of the new US President, Barack Obama. Apart from symbolizing a dramatic change of power, the kanji also echoed Obama's campaign slogan, "Change You Can Believe In." Political change in Japan was also on the agenda in 2008, as it had been in 2007. These two years saw successive Japanese prime ministers resign. And, of course, 2008 was an Olympic year. This was reflected by the second most popular kanji, kin, or "gold." Japan won its fair share of gold medals, although not as many as the host nation, China. The Japanese public hopes that this year will be deserving of a positive kanji.
