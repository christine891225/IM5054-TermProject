Niki de Saint Phalle, one of the most famous artists of the 20th century, was a French-American born in 1930. She was brought up in a very conservative family, and yet, she rejected the staid, conservative values of her family to pursue a career in painting. Her rebelliousness created a series of conflicts with her family, which led to a nervous breakdown at age 23. Fortunately, painting offered her an effective therapy and a way to develop as an artist. Her famous “Nana” series gained universal praise. It is a testimony to the glory of women.   The series is mostly composed of life-size dolls of women in various roles such as brides and new mothers. Some of these sculptures are very big, “so that men would look small next to them.” Saint Phalle used vivid colors in these works and her female subjects dance cheerfully and merrily. Through these joyful and powerful images of Nana, the artist sends a positive message to all women. Saint Phalle’s sculptural park, “The Tarot Garden,” inspired by Tarot cards, is situated in the Italian province of Tuscany. Work on the garden began in 1979, and it was officially opened to the public in May 1998. The park contains sculptures of the symbols found on Tarot cards. The brightly colored combinations of buildings and sculptures reflect the metaphysical qualities represented by the 22 main tarot cards. The sculptures, however, have nothing to do with fortune telling. Instead, the works focus on the elements of life experience, personality, and self-knowledge that the cards refer to. Saint Phalle passed away on May 21, 2002, in San Diego, California, at the age of 71. Her death meant the loss of a woman of diverse creative talents.
