All advertising includes an attempt to persuade. To put it another way, ads are communication designed to get someone to do something.  Even if an advertisement claims to be purely informational, it still has persuasion at its core. The ad informs the consumers with one purpose: to get the consumer to like the brand and, on that basis, to eventually buy the brand. Without this persuasive intent, communication about a product might be news, but it would not be advertising. Advertising can be persuasive communication not only about a product but also an idea or a person. Political advertising is one example. Although political ads are supposed to be concerned with the public welfare, they are paid for and they all have a persuasive intent. They differ from commercial ads in that political ads “sell” candidates rather than commercial goods. A Bush campaign ad, for instance, did not ask anyone to buy anything, yet it attempted to persuade American citizens to view George Bush favorably. Aside from campaign advertising, political advertising is also used to persuade people to support or oppose proposals. Critics of President Clinton’s health care plan used advertising to influence lawmakers and defeat the government’s plan. In addition to political parties, environmental groups and human rights organizations also buy advertising to persuade people to accept their way of thinking. For instance, the international organization Greenpeace uses advertising to get their message out. In the ads, they warn people about serious pollution problems and the urgency of protecting the environment. They, too, are selling something and trying to make a point.
