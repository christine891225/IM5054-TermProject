Researchers have been searching for cures for diseases for centuries. Great strides have been made in medicine in the last fifty years, and one of the major improvements has been in the area of regenerative medicine. In particular, researchers believe that the field of stem cell treatment has the ability to completely revolutionize health care. Though still in its experimental stages, regenerative medicine has the potential to alleviate suffering and treat many diseases. Treatment of diseases such as cancer, Type I diabetes, injuries to the spinal cord, and other muscle damage could be greatly advanced if stem cell research proves to be as effective as researchers hope. During an illness or injury, healthy cells are destroyed. In the case of leukemia, the effects of chemotherapy ravage the healthy cells. Stem cells, either harvested earlier from the person now suffering from the disease, or an outside donor, help to produce new, healthy cells. These new cells set to work healing and repairing the body. In one experiment, researchers wanted to see how stem cells could combat cancerous cells. They injected the stem cells into a rodent with tumors. Within days, the newly injected stem cells shrank the tumors by 80 percent. Outside of the lab, Korean researchers are reporting a human victory in their research. In 2004, they transplanted stem cells to a patient suffering from a spinal cord injury. As a result, she can now walk on her own. Prior to the treatment, she hadn't stood in 19 years.
