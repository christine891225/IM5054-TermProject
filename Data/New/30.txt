On April 15, 2019, a fire broke out in Notre-Dame cathedral in Paris. Completed in the 11th century, this landmark is one of the most recognizable buildings in France, and people around the world worried over its fate. Luckily, much of the inside was saved, but the majority of the wooden roof was destroyed. Plans have been made to replace it, but some are not happy with how it will be done. Soon after the fire, the French government announced an international competition to design a new roof. The Prime Minster invited architects to design a replacement that was "adapted to the techniques and challenges of our era". Some very interesting and modern designs started coming in, including one that transformed the top of Notre-Dame into an urban farm that would produce food for the city's poor, and another that would be made entirely from recycled plastic fished out of the ocean. In the end, however, the French National Heritage and Architecture Commission decided that the new roof should be built exactly like the previous one. The public was supportive of restoring the cathedral to its former look, but concerns have arisen about how authentically they're making it. The government announced that over 1,000 150-to-200-year-old oak trees would be removed to recreate the spire that used to stand on the roof and another 1,500 for the roof itself. Cutting down so many old trees greatly offended environmentalists. Over 42,000 people petitioned the government to reconsider their decision, but it appears they have been largely ignored.
Despite originally stating that the roof would be repaired by 2024, finding the trees they need will end up delaying the project significantly. Experts say it is more likely to take 15 to 20 years to restore the roof, much longer than the two years originally planned. Hopefully in that time, environmental groups will get the plans reconsidered.
