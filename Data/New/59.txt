As police forces become better equipped to catch bad guys, criminals themselves are having to come up with increasingly clever tactics. One particular robber near the US city of Seattle used the Internet site Craigslist as his partner in crime. First, the robber posted an advertisement on the site seeking workers for a road maintenance project. The workers were told to meet near a bank the next day at a particular time. Furthermore, they were instructed to wear yellow vests and bring goggles and a face mask. The next day, around a dozen men showed up. However, there was no road work to be done. Instead, while they were hanging around and waiting, the identically dressed robber was busy committing his crime. The robber walked up to an armored car, attacked the guard with pepper spray and ran off with the bags of money. Leaving the workers behind to confuse the police and witnesses, the robber raced toward a nearby river. The method of his escape was just as creative. Instead of a car or motorbike, he jumped into a rubber inner tube and floated away. An eyewitness reported the getaway to the police. Later, a discarded inner-tube was found about 200 yards downriver from the scene of the crime. Many were amused by the story of the robber's crazy crime and escape plan. One local resident commented: "Creative. Not a right way of doing
it, but creative." While we surely shouldn't encourage such criminal acts, it's hard not to feel a degree of respect for the architect of such an inventive plan.
