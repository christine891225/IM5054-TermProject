Pleasure is an important component of the quality of life, but by itself it does not bring happiness. Sleep, rest, food, and sex provide restorative balanced experiences that return consciousness to order, but they do not produce psychological growth. When people ponder further about what makes their lives rewarding, they tend to move beyond pleasant memories. They also begin to remember other events, other experiences that overlap with pleasurable ones but fall into a category that deserves a separate name: enjoyment. Enjoyment is characterized by a forward movement, by a sense of novelty, or by a sense of accomplishment. Playing a close game of tennis that stretches one's ability is enjoyable, as is reading a book that reveals things in a new light, as is having a conversation that leads us to express ideas we didn't know we had. Closing a contested business deal, or any piece of work well done, is enjoyable. None of these experiences may be particularly pleasurable at the time they are taking place. However, after an enjoyable event we know that we have changed, become more complex, and that our self has grown. Experiences that give pleasure can also give enjoyment, but the two sensations are quite different. A person can feel pleasure without any effort. Nevertheless, it is impossible to enjoy a tennis game, a book, or a conversation unless attention is fully concentrated on the activity.
