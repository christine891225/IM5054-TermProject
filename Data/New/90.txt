Obesity is a growing problem all around the world. After obesity comes the problem of diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure and many other health problems. Oftentimes, even if people know clearly which kind of food is beneficial, it is still hard for them to resist the temptation of tasty food. For many Americans, for example, this means fried food, sweets, and soft drinks. Many scientists and even governments are aware of this alarming trend, and have been working hard to keep people healthy. For instance, in 1992, the U.S. Department of Agriculture created the Food Guide Pyramid. It was meant to illustrate the proportions of foods making up a healthy diet. At the bottom of the Pyramid, where the triangle is widest, are 11 servings of foods containing complex carbohydrates. One level up the Pyramid calls for three to five servings of vegetables and two to four servings of fruit. At the very top, where there isn't much room, are foods that are not supposed to take up much room in your diet. By and large, the basic structure of the Food Pyramid still serves as a guideline for many nutritionists. However, the U.S. Department of Agriculture has received a great deal of criticism. For example, does apple pie belong with sweets or fruits? Other problems like portion size and exactly how big a serving is remain unclear. To come up with a more up-to-date chart, a panel of 13 experts tried to gather information and collect comments from the public. Yet, no matter how desirable the Pyramid may be, the most important guideline seems to carry out a healthy diet. After all, you are what you eat.
