On the "horn" of northeastern Africa lies Somalia, one of the most unstable and impoverished nations in the world. The country has suffered from decades of war and corruption, gaining a reputation as a lawless land. In recent years, however, it is incidents not on land but in the waters off its coast that have put Somalia in the spotlight. The country has become notorious for piracy. Somalia's pirates bear little resemblance to the characters portrayed in Hollywood movies. For one thing, they don't sail around in grand ships. Instead, they ride in tiny, cramped speedboats.
However, since the pirates are heavily armed with machine guns and grenade launchers, boat size isn't an issue. Indeed, their methods have proved extremely effective. In 2008, more than 90 ships were seized, three times more than in 2007. Once a ship is captured, its crew is held hostage until a ransom is paid. The process can last for months, but having made vast sums of money in ransoms to date, the pirates have learned to practice patience. The "business" of piracy has become so successful here that in certain regions, it has served to drive the local economy. This is no truer than in Puntland, where fine mansions are springing up and sports cars are an increasingly common sight. Besides the attackers, townspeople are employed to occupy the ships and feed the hostages. Piracy, therefore, has become the most thriving industry in town. In an effort to curb the attacks, several countries have committed warships to
patrol the dangerous waters. But this may just be a drop in the ocean when it comes to effectively dealing with the Somali pirates.
