Excessive wishful thinking is not an asset on a voyage to a remote location. And yet, that's all S. A. André felt he needed for his expedition from Sweden to the North Pole: not excess food, or cold weather clothing, or technical equipment. Just hope, in great abundance, as if it alone could conquer the elements.
André set out with his team in 1897. Their method of transport was, of all things, a hot air balloon. The plan: pass over the North Pole and then land in Canada. Or maybe Alaska. Or Russia. Or wherever the wind took them was fine with André. Though a test flight in 1896 failed (because the winds were blowing hard from the north), the balloon finally took off in 1897. Immediately, however, it dropped almost to sea level. The crew scrambled to remove weight to get the balloon soaring again. It worked, but the lighter balloon now began to ascend to a dangerously high altitude. Only a few minutes after taking off, the André expedition was in serious trouble. The leader, not surprisingly, was clueless. The original plans had the balloon flying for a 30 day period. In reality, it lasted a little over two days in the air. The three crew members found themselves stranded on ice flows in the middle of nowhere. After a few weeks, they reached an island, but with little food they quickly died. No one back in civilization, of course, knew of their fate. It wasn't until 1930 that a Norwegian sealing ship found their remains. When the bodies were brought back home to Sweden, they were received as heroes.
