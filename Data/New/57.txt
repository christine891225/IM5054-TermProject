Are you feeling nervous about a big test? With so much pressure, you may be losing sleep and your ability to concentrate. How can you deal with stress, study effectively, and take your test with confidence? Maybe you should try meditation. When people think of meditation, many picture old men sitting cross-legged on remote mountaintops. But it is not necessary to travel to a mountaintop or become a guru to enjoy the benefits of meditation. All you need to do is find a place where you can sit or lie down comfortably for a little while and concentrate. This could be a shady spot in a park, a warm bath, or simply your bed. The secret to meditation is controlling your breathing. Close your eyes and start taking slow breaths. Focus on the air moving in and out of your body. If your mind starts to wander, refocus your attention on your breathing. Sometimes, playing soft music or listening to a recording of the ocean can help you concentrate when meditating. Importantly, meditation has little to do with escaping problems or thinking about nothing. Rather, rhythmic breathing has a calming effect and allows you to focus your thoughts. The issues you have on your mind will then unfold clearly, as if they were in slow motion. This clarity is called mindfulness." Being mindful means that you are aware of your thoughts without becoming overwhelmed by them. It takes practice, but with time, that big test won't scare you anymore.
