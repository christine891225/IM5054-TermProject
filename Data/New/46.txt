When Sean Aiken graduated from business school, he began looking for a job. But Sean was ambitious- he did not just look for one job. Instead, he decided to work a different job every week for an entire year. Sean was trying to get as much job-related experience as he could to help him decide on a career. In order to achieve this, Sean was willing to travel to any place where someone would hire him. Fortunately, many people were happy to help. One of the reasons for this was that Sean planned to donate all of the money he made to charity. Sean managed to acquire quite a variety of experiences. He started off as a bungee jumping operator in week one. Then he went on to work as a pizza maker, an advertising executive, and a cowboy. He
even got to work with the Canadian Air Force. In addition, perhaps to the envy of many, he spent a whole week in Hollywood with a top movie producer. Bringing things around full circle, Sean finished his adventure as mayor of his hometown in British Colombia, Canada. Not only did Sean learn a lot from the experience, he also inspired countless others. Young people tracking Sean's progress began to think more about what they wanted from a job. Sean's experiences encouraged them to think about following their passions rather than simply doing what pays the bills. After 52 weeks and 52 jobs, Sean finally managed to narrow down his search.
