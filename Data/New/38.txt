Kobe Bryant is known around the world as one of the greatest basketball players of all time. He began his professional career in 1996 when he was drafted into the NBA from high school. He was only the sixth player to ever go straight into the league without playing for a college team first. Obviously, Bryant had lots of talent, and he also had a lot of confidence in his abilities. However, his attitude caused some of his teammates to label him as arrogant, and they often complained about his selfish playing style. After spending a few years maturing and improving, 1999 became a turning point for Bryant. He helped the Lakers win three consecutive championships and earned respect for his ability to play under pressure. At just 23 years old, Bryant became the youngest NBA player to win three championships, and in 2002 earned his first All-Star game MVP award. He would earn three more over the duration of his career. Unfortunately, things went badly for Bryant in 2003 when he was arrested for sexual assault. The incident harmed the Lakers' season and caused issues between Bryant, his teammates, and the coach. After two bad seasons, things turned around. Bryant went back to being one of the league's top players and was embraced again by his fans. He went on to have an impressive career and set many league records. When he retired from the game in 2016, he was the first guard to ever have a 20-year career in the NBA. Unexpected tragedy struck in 2020 when Bryant and his daughter were killed in a helicopter accident. The world was shocked and saddened by the news, especially those in the sporting world. To honor the man and his legacy, he was inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame a few months following his death. Although he is no longer with us, Kobe Bryant will long be remembered for everything he achieved.
