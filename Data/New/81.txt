Laser means “light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation.” A laser is an object that produces beams of light which can travel very long distances. Such beams are so powerful that they can cut through a diamond, the hardest material in the world.  The first lasers were developed in the 1950s by American and Russian scientists. However, the idea of creating beams of light that are very powerful had come up a century before. At that time lasers existed purely in science fiction, devised by writers like HG Wells. In his novel War of the Worlds, for example, he wrote about Martians who had a weapon called a heat ray. Normal light consists of many wavelengths and colors. Laser light, in contrast, does not scatter but moves in the same direction. It produces light in a single color and wavelength.  When electrons move from a lower level to a higher level around an atom, they emit a photon, a particle of light. After that, they tend to fall back to their original orbit. Nowadays, lasers are used in many situations in different areas of life. For example, they are used to record and store different kinds of information.  They also act as instruments, when exact measurements are needed. Therefore you can find lasers in various medical instruments in hospitals. Lasers can also produce 3D images. Modern medicine uses lasers to destroy tumors in human body or to correct eyesight. Many surgeons perform operations with laser beams instead of knives.  They use lasers to remove damaged tissue from a patient’s body without destroying the cells around it. Living in a world where lasers have been widely applied to different aspects of life, we may start to ponder over where, when, and how we can use them to an extreme degree for the welfare of all humans.
