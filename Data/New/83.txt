Asia's first Legoland theme park opened in Malaysia on September 15, 2012. Legoland Malaysia is located in the city of Johor Bahru in the southern tip of Peninsula Malaysia near the border with Singapore. It draws many local Malaysians and visitors from Singapore and other countries. The theme park is 76 acres of adventure, featuring a variety of rides and thousands of Lego models made out of the popular toy bricks. Nearly all of the rides are hands-on, so visitors can build, pedal, steer and splash. Its cluster of attractions are expected to transform the sleepy region into a thriving tourist hub. The theme park is packed with more than 40 rides, shows and attractions. Most rides are for children under the age of 12, but the theme park also has a variety of attractions for the whole family like the "4D Lego Studios." There is something for everyone in the theme park, young and old alike. The whole family can thus embark on a day-long voyage of discovery and adventure. The main highlight of the park is Miniland. On a scale of 1:20, famous Asian towns and landscapes have been recreated from over 30 million LEGO bricks. Visitors can take in Asian landmarks like the Great Wall in China and Malaysia's iconic Petronas Twin Towers. To make Miniland as realistic as possible, people, animals, cars, ships, trains and airplanes can be moved at the touch of a button together with the appropriate background noises.
Legoland Malaysia is the sixth Legoland theme park in the world, after those in Denmark, Britain, Germany and Florida and California in the United States. With 40 interactive rides and attractions, it is hoped that the park will attract more than 1.5 million people a year. There are also plans to develop the park further and for it to become the largest destination resort in Southeast Asia. A waterpark will open in 2013 and a themed hotel within the grounds of the attraction is scheduled to open in 2014.
