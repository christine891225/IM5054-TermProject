Early in 2020, the city of Wuhan, China, became the first place to order its citizens to stay home due to the COVID-19 outbreak. One after the other, cities around the world followed suit and lockdown became the new normal. Such measures to stop the spread of the disease posed serious problems to the global economy. However, they also had unexpected benefits for the natural world. One of the first of these positive effects was a significant increase in air quality. As transportation and industrial activities ground to a halt, cities around the world-including New York, Seoul, and London-enjoyed a dramatic reduction in harmful air pollution. These improvements soon became obvious in nature as well, as skies became bluer, rivers clearer, and people rediscovered the pleasure of breathing clean air. Wildlife has also benefited from the lack of human activity. Not long into the global lockdown, wild animals were seen reclaiming the land. In Thailand, leatherback turtles were able to nest on empty beaches. It wasn't only turtles that enjoyed more freedom. Other animals became increasingly bold and began to enter places usually reserved for humans. Deer were spotted in people's gardens, and wild boar, sheep, goats, and even kangaroos were seen on city streets.
The news hasn't been all good, however. Along with other businesses, some conservation organizations have had to close their doors and cease their work, at least for the time being. There is also concern about the illegal trading of wild animals. Many hoped this immoral practice would end due to fears of infection, but it seems as though it may actually be increasing. As people lose their regular jobs, they are turning to work like illegal trading for income. It remains to be seen whether the positive environmental effects of the 2020 global lockdown will be long-lasting or just a temporary break before humans return to "business as usual."
