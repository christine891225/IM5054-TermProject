Jacuzzis, those bathtubs with bubbles, have long been synonymous with luxury hotels and celebrity homes. But for the Jacuzzi family, it was a long and unpredictable road that led them to develop the namesake product identified with indulgent relaxation. The original seven Jacuzzi brothers were Italian immigrants who arrived in America in the early 1900s in search of the American Dream. They formed an aviation company and soon developed the first enclosed cabin monoplane. In the 1920s, they moved into the agricultural pump industry. It was expertise gained in this field that helped in the development of the Jacuzzi whirlpool bath. But it was an accident of history that the brothers ever developed one in the first place. In the fifties, the son of Candido Jacuzzi, the youngest of the seven brothers, was found to have rheumatoid arthritis. This condition causes great stiffness and pain in the body. To help the young boy, the Jacuzzis produced a portable pump that could be used in a bath of water to massage the body with jets of water. The results were highly therapeutic, and soon the brothers hit on the idea to market their device to hospitals and schools. The modern self-contained Jacuzzi whirlpool bath was the invention of Roy Jacuzzi. In 1968, Roy introduced the "Roman Bath," in which the jets were built directly into the bath itself. Roy displayed his invention at fairs and trade shows, and his timing could not have been better. In the late 1960s and 70s, public interest in health, fitness, and leisure was growing, so sales of Jacuzzis exploded. Today, Jacuzzi is the biggest name in whirlpool type baths, and their products are found more and more in the houses of ordinary people.
