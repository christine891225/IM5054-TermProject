The first successful heart transplant operation in the world was carried out in December 1967. From that time until the present day, the only accepted way to preserve a donor heart has been to pack it in ice inside a cooler box. Even then, the heart will usually only be viable, and capable of being transplanted, for between four to six hours. The existing system is that donor hearts are transported in their cool boxes between hospitals by the speediest means possible. Depending on geography, this usually means the heart is sent either by road, air, or a combination of the two. The problems of this are obvious; traffic jams, bad weather, or mechanical difficulties can cause such serious delays that the heart may not arrive in time. Additionally, a heart can be damaged when it's warmed up at the end of the surgery. The time constraint means that the heart can't be tested to see if it works until after the transplant operation. Statistically, from five percent to seven percent of hearts don't work after they've been transplanted. The psychological effect on the recipient, and the surgical team, can be traumatic. But, according to pediatric heart surgeon Dr. Mark Plunkett, all that may soon change. A new heart-preservation system has been designed which maintains the organ in a warm, beating and functioning physiological state. A sterile box is made for this purpose. It is heated, and includes a small device that pumps warm, oxygenated donor blood through the heart the entire time it's in transit. This means that the heart can keep beating outside the donor body for up to 12 hours. The still-beating heart can also be monitored en route to keep it in optimal condition. An additional benefit of the new system is the ability to more comprehensively assess the heart prior to implantation. This should lead to improved immediate and long-term heart function, reduce the risk of organ rejection and thus increase the number of hearts available for transplant.
