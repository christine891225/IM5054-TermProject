With an idea in mind, Kyle MacDonald started an online project in 2005 to see how much he could get in trade for a red paperclip. His dream was to continue trading until he had a house. To kick the project off, he posted a picture of a red paperclip on his blog and asked if anyone wanted to make a trade.  MacDonald’s first trade happened two days later, when he received a fish pen in return for his red paperclip. Within months of his first trade, he was trading for some big-ticket items.  Things he got included such as a snowmobile, a van, a recording contract, and a fully-furnished rent-free apartment for one year. He never held on to any of the items, though. He even traded for an afternoon with one of the greatest rock stars in the world, Alice Cooper. When he got that offer, Kyle was really tempted to stop his project and spend time with his rock idol. However, he persevered with his goal of getting a house.  After making 14 trades, Kyle was able to make a trade for a house. Despite all the wonderful things Kyle was offered, he says that the most important trade was his very first one. That red paperclip represented an idea. The most important thing anyone can do with an idea is to do it.  An idea will never be more than an idea—if you don’t have the courage to follow your dreams.
