Fiction is the name we use for stories that are make-believe, such as Harry Potter or Alice in the Wonderland. But fiction isn’t always different from the way things usually are It can be so close to the truth that it seems as real as something that happened to you this morning. Or, fiction can be as fantastic as the most unbelievable fairy tale. Not everything in a fictional story has to be made up. You could write a story in which you fly to the moon. You, of course, are real, and the moon is real, and many of the things that you could describe, such as the stars, the wind, and the pull of gravity, would be real. But your trip through space would be fiction. It would be a trip you took in your imagination. Nonfiction, on the other hand, is all about true things. Nothing is made up. Someone’s biography is nonfiction; so is your autobiography. So are articles in your local newspaper, and school reports on science. History is nonfiction, too. Imagine writing history about the 1989 San Francisco earthquake, or a report about a high school sports team. An old proverb says, “Truth is stranger than fiction.” Do you think that’s true?
