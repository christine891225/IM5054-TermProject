Belly dance is enjoyed throughout the world. It is both a beautiful art form and a great form of exercise for women and men of all ages. Belly dance can be compared to any other aerobic workout, because it is vigorous and will make you break a sweat. The fast movements of the hips and shoulders are enough to really get your heart pumping, offering tremendous cardiovascular benefits. On the other hand, it is also low-impact; the melodious, flowing movements of belly dance help to calm and soothe the mind. That's why belly dance is indeed good for the body, both physically and mentally. But do you know how this dance form began or how it got the name? The exact origin is actively debated among dance enthusiasts. The most popular theory is that it evolved from a religious dance.	  Temple priestesses performed such a dance form. Another popular theory is that it arose out of the dance that was associated with childbirth and was part of the fertility ritual. Since some belly dance moves center around controlling the muscles of the abdomen, it may make carrying and delivering a baby easier on the body. AS for what the dance form should be called, it is even more debated. The term "belly dance" is believed to have come from a French term, meaning "dance of the stomach." However, there is really no correct word or name. In fact, every part of the body is involved in the dance, and the most featured body part is usually the hips. Interesting, isn't it?
