Prosthetic devices are artificial attachments or limbs that are designed to replace body parts missing because of an accident, disease, or birth defect. They have a long history, with records of their use going back to ancient Egypt, Greece, and Rome. One copper and wood leg unearthed in Italy in 1850, for example, dates back to around 300 BC. But while the use of prosthetic devices may be ages old, modern advancements have improved them beyond belief. Improvements have been as much cosmetic as mechanical. With materials such as silicone and new plastics, an artificial hand, for example, can now be made to look totally realistic. It can show veins, blemishes, and even fingerprints. The most noteworthy improvements, however, have been those that have A development called myoelectrics uses electrodes to transfer impulses from muscle movements to small motors in the artificial limb. This gives the brought more comfort and increased mobility to wearers. wearer more control over their movements than ever before. Scientists and engineers are also working to perfect a robotic limb that is directly controlled by the impulses of the brain. Such an advance will allow for more and more subtle movements. The day when people using artificial limbs will be able to do anything that able-bodied people can is very close. But where will the field go after this goal is reached? Not surprisingly, there is much talk about prosthetic enhancement, that is, replacing healthy body parts simply to improve upon them. The cyborgs of science fiction storylines, those half-man half-machine creatures, may not be fictional for too much longer.
