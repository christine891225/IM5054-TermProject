In 2009, the Kenyan government started a scheme to rehouse the residents of the Kibera settlement, one of Africa's largest informal settlements built on unstable land. On the surface, this scheme will provide many financial benefits for the city. First, it will help tackle the enduring poverty that exists in informal communities, which in turn will increase the city's economy as people gain formal employment and pay taxes. Second, governments will reclaim the land and nearby city residents will no longer feel that informal settlements impact on the value of their own homes. However, it is possible that the scheme in Kibera will suffer from a problem that similar projects have experienced in the past. That is, residents choosing to return to their old community. One reason for this is cost. The new accommodation in Kibera may appear cheap to the outside world at SIO a month. But for 60% of the Kibera population living on $1 a day and for the 80% of Kebera youth who are unemployed, it may still be prohibitively expensive. As a result, some residents may choose to stay in the settlement and rent out their new homes to middle-class families at a profit. Informal settlement rehousing projects have both advantages and disadvantages. They offer clean, comfortable accommodation, but they can also take people away from their families, employment, and the community. In light of this, it seems that rehousing is the most effective option when settlements are situated on unstable land or land without rights. In addition, when rehousing people it is important that those people are involved in the planning process to ensure that new housing is affordable and a successful community is created. With an estimated growth of two billion in the global population by 2030, it is vital that cities address this issue today in order to prepare for the future.
