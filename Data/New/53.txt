If you like big parties, how does a celebration with over a billion people sound? That's how many people are expected to observe Earth Day this April 22. They can't all get together in one place, of course, but they can unite in spirit. Celebrated in 175 different countries, the event aims to spread environmental awareness all around the world. Earth Day's importance is demonstrated by its immense popularity. In fact, the occasion is now considered to be "the largest secular holiday in the world."
The first Earth Day was celebrated on April 22, 1970, in the United States. In many ways, the holiday was the result of the environmental concern that had been growing throughout the previous decade. It took a massive oil spill in early 1970, however, to convince people that something needed to be done. People could finally see the impact human activity was having on the world. One of the environmental movement's most important leaders was US Senator Gaylord Nelson. Nelson went to Washington D.C. and convinced Congress to pass a bill that would establish a day to promote environmental awareness. That same year also saw the passing of a number of bills that were not, like Earth Day, merely symbolic in nature. These included the Clean Air Act, as well as bills protecting drinking water, the soil, and woodlands. Taiwan celebrates Earth Day, and there are many activities you can get involved in. Perhaps the most important activity, though, is getting into a daily habit of environmental consciousness. After all, we may only celebrate Earth Day once a year, but it is vital that we live the message it promotes every day.
