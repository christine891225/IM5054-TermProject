Many people say that e-mail is just a faster way to deliver letters. The fact is that letter writing and e-mail are completely different processes. Handwritten or typed, letters travel in envelopes through actual space and take time getting from one place to another. The time and distance, as a matter of fact, influence the letter-writer. If I am writing on paper to my brother in Kenya, I will be less likely to complain about the breakfast I had this morning. I will probably write about my relationships and some things that I’ve been thinking about. I will also take more care with my style, trying to write in a way that is interesting and worth reading. People tend to regard letters as important. My brother might save my letter; he might read it back to me years from now. E-mail is different. It is instant, traveling from point to point. If you don’t print it out, the message doesn’t physically exist. With e-mail, geography is no obstacle and time is not important. I can zap a message to Kenya whenever I want to, and it gets there almost in a second. The ease of this kind of writing and sending probably makes for a different kind of communication. I can complain about the breakfast I had this morning or rattle on about friends and movies. That is because I am not so focused on style and profundity. The downside is, I might be less likely to say something deeper. My brother might glance at my mail, have a laugh, and then delete it.
