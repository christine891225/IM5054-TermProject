In the age of easy travel and Internet connectivity, the world is becoming more and more globalized. Therefore, it's important for people to be familiar with different work cultures. Everything ranging from greetings to work hours can vary, so keep reading to learn about a few major differences. Let's begin with the basics: greetings. Even these simple gestures can vary tremendously across cultures. For instance, an American businessman will greet you with a handshake, a Japanese businessman will bow to you, and a German businessman might give you a handshake and a nod. How you respond can affect your work and business relationships. There are also differences in communication styles, as well as work hours, among cultures. For example, in Western countries, one's thoughts are usually expressed directly. However, people in Asia tend to convey their feelings in more subtle ways. The practice of mid-workday naps is also quite common in some Eastern countries. There's even a name for it in Japan-inemuri-which means "present while sleeping." Perhaps these naps are common due to Japan's long work hours. Other work cultures are known for being more relaxed. For example, the French work only thirty-five hours per week and are guaranteed at least five weeks of vacation a year. This gives them more time to be with family and friends and participate in hobbies-some of the best things about life. Meanwhile, many people in Spain have three-hour lunch breaks. Some workers might even go home and eat a home-cooked meal during their break. Some people say that relaxed practices like these damage a country's economy. Conversely, others believe the long hours and high pressure of some work cultures are unhealthy and do not equate to more productivity. Either way, work culture--like human beings--is generally resistant to change, so you should go ahead and familiarize yourself with some different styles.
