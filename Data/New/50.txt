Since the beginning of civilization, people have been trying to devise methods to keep track of time. While all systems are based on the changes we observe in the day, the moon, and the seasons, there are some big differences. For instance, the Chinese new year usually begins in late January or early February, while for the West, it always begins on January 1. Most of the systems we use now have long histories that record many changes. Prior to the reign of Julius Caesar, the Western calendar consisted of 355 days. To make up for the missing days, an extra month was sometimes added between February and March. But this bonus month wasn't added consistently. Politicians often threw in an extra month to lengthen their own terms of office. To standardize the calendar, Julius Caesar lengthened all the months but February; for that month, he added a leap day to occur every four years. Centuries later, it was observed that even this calendar was not entirely accurate over long periods of time. This led Pope Gregory XIII in the 16th century to move ten days forward and establish the Gregorian calendar. If the changes to the Western calendar seem complicated, consider the Chinese one. In the last 2,500 years, it has been reformed nearly 100 times! We'd need a whole chapter just to summarize them.
