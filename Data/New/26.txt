In the age of the Internet, almost everything a person wants is a click away. The only thing that may seem out of reach is a way to find meaningful friendships. A recent survey by the BBC found that 40% of 16- to 24-year-olds feel lonely often or very often. It's an interesting finding because early adulthood is when it's assumed a person's best friendships are formed. It's a time without a lot of responsibilities, so there should be time to really focus on meeting new people. Unfortunately, one of the drawbacks to living in the digital age is that people often spend so much time online that they miss out on real-life interactions.
Kate Leaver, a journalist and author of the book The Friendship Cure, says that when we surround ourselves with social media, we don't recognize how isolated we actually are. Receiving likes and comments on one's posts can make a person feel connected in the moment. However, when those social media friends can't meet up for a cup of coffee, it's obvious these types of friendships aren't that strong.
Recognizing the issue is easy, but solving it is a lot harder. For one thing, current social norms prevent us from approaching strangers in public spaces and inviting them to do something. Most people would be too nervous to even try. So perhaps the answer is to find better ways to combine online chats with real-world experiences. There has been a rise in friendship apps attempting to do that. Many of them work as dating platforms, where users browse profiles and match with potential new friends.
There are also specialized apps for people with specific interests they'd like to bond over. The modern world has brought many conveniences, but it's also introduced new problems. Finding real friends has become harder, but for those who crave real-life friendships, it's still possible if you look in the right places.
