Ramadan is celebrated annually by Muslims around the world. It takes place during the ninth month of the Muslim calendar and is considered the most sacred month of year by Muslims. The month lasts between 29 and 30 days based upon the first sighting of the crescent moon. This annual practice is considered one of the Five Pillars of Islam. Fasting, an integral part of the observance is compulsory for Muslims once they reach puberty. Exemptions to fasting include illness, old age, menstruation, pregnancy, breast-feeding and travel. In most cases, people will not allow illness to get in the way of celebrating Ramadan. Thus, healthcare professionals will be needed to closely monitor their patients who decide to persist with fasting. Fasting begins at dawn each day and lasts till sunset. During the day, Muslims refrain from eating, drinking, smoking and sexual relations. This allows them to emphasize the religious side of their lives. Muslims spend each day in prayer and in the study of the Quran. At sunset, families can
partake of a fast-breaking meal. The act of fasting is said to redirect the heart away from worldly activities, its purpose being to cleanse the soul by freeing it from harmful impurities. Ramadan also teaches Muslims how to better practice self-discipline, self-control, sacrifice, and empathy for those who are less fortunate. During Ramadan, a sense of good will toward their fellow people permeates the holiday, since charity is very important in Islam, and even more so
during Ramadan. Actions of generosity and compulsory charity are encouraged during the period. Ramadan is indeed a time of spiritual reflection, worship and introspection.
