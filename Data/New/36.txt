Convenience stores use them to heat up ready-made food. Busy households consider them a blessing for last-minute meal preparation. We are, of course, talking about microwave ovens. While these inventions have become common in modern life, many still worry that they may have ill effects on our health. To learn the truth about microwaves, let's examine a few common concerns. Many believe that microwaves cause cancer. This is, in fact, a myth. Microwaves work by sending radiation into food and exciting its liquid molecules. The friction of these molecules heats the food. The radiation produced by a microwave is mostly contained in the oven, but even if that weren't the case, the radiation is still too weak to give us cancer. Standing in front of a microwave is completely safe. What's not safe, however, is microwaving plastic. Harmful chemicals can leak into the food when the plastic containers are heated. Use heatproof glass or ceramic containers instead when microwaving food. There are a few other things that shouldn't be microwaved, like raw or starchy foods. Microwaves tend to heat things unevenly, so dense food can end up with the outer edges cooked to a crisp and the center still raw. Furthermore, laboratory tests have shown that microwaving starchy foods like potatoes can increase their levels of acrylamide, a substance that may cause cancer when consumed. Therefore, it's best to use a stove or regular oven to cook raw or starchy food and reserve the microwave for heating leftovers. However, do these leftovers lose nutrients when they are microwaved? It depends. Any type of cooking will alter a food's nutritional content. For example, boiling vegetables can cause certain nutrients and antioxidants to escape into the water. Microwaving might actually preserve a food's nutritional content better than boiling does. All in all, microwaves are a perfectly safe appliance to use. Just be aware of their limitations so that you can use them correctly.
