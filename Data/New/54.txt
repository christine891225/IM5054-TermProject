As the world's largest primate, mountain gorillas are covered with thick black hair, can grow to over six feet tall, and weigh over 400 pounds. They are so strong that they could easily crush a human with the brute force of their arms! Surprisingly, they are vegetarians and seldom drink water. All the water they need is provided to them through the rainforest plants they ingest. Male mountain gorillas consume over 70 pounds of plants each day. Despite their size and strength, the mountain gorilla's days are numbered Some are killed by traps hunters set for other animals, and even eaten for their meat. Currently, there are a mere 700 mountain gorillas left in the wild. Over half of them Incidentally, hunters are not the only humans that threaten their survival. live in the Virungas, a mountain range in Central Africa. Eager tourists are flocking to the Virungas, hoping to catch a glimpse of the gorillas. In the process, they pass infectious diseases on to the gorillas, which can be lethal. Furthermore, as humans develop the region, the gorillas' habitat is shrinking. While many zoos have contributed greatly to gorilla research and conservation, some have also posed another threat to the mountain gorilla. Attempts to capture individual gorillas from the wild often results in the deaths of their kin, who usually try to prevent the capture. The captured gorillas often don't survive the transport, and the breeding and survival rate in zoos is generally lower than in the wild. Although there are more mountain gorillas today than there were decades ago, their future is still quite uncertain. It will take the efforts of many concerned conservationists to help
save the mountain gorilla from extinction.
