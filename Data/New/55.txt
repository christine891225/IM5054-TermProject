For a long time, environmentalists have expressed concern over the use of plastics in product packaging. This is because plastics generally create a lot of waste. Also, certain chemicals used in the manufacturing of plastics are poisonous. If those chemicals entered the food chain, through soil or water, the results would be terrible. Given these facts, it's no surprise that news of a different type of plastic is generating a lot of excitement. The plastic, called PHBV, is made from plant matter. It has been developed by six universities working together in Taiwan. The researchers say no oil or harmful substances are used in making PHBV. Best of all, it can be quickly reduced to just water and one other chemical, which doesn't harm nature. The raw material for PHBV is made by letting bacteria feed on rice and soy milk. The entire process is completely safe. Moreover, a discarded PHBV bottle would break down completely in about a week. This is very significant when you consider that 200 million tons of plastic are produced each year. Therefore, switching to PHBV could relieve an enormous burden on the environment. PHBV is not the only environmentally friendly plastic out there. It is, however, one of the cheapest ones to manufacture. In fact, it can be produced for half the cost of its nearest rival.
Nevertheless, PHBV isn't perfect. For one thing, it must be broken down at a special industrial unit. Regular sites don't contain enough oxygen and bacteria to do the job. However, with pollution from traditional plastics manufacturing such a serious problem, PHBV is definitely a step in the right direction.
