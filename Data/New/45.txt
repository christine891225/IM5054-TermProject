Reading the blogs of soldiers on active duty in Iraq provides a fascinating glimpse of life in the middle of a war zone. But one anonymous soldier's blog (now-alas-taken offline by the US Army) also offers a very moving story about hope in "the gravest of places." One day, while driving a military truck, the blog's author accidentally damages an old Kurdish man's car. Breaking protocol, the soldier gets out of his vehicle to apologize. More astonishingly, he tells the old man that he will see that the car is repaired. He then leaves, promising to return in a week. True to his word, the soldier returns and, on finding the old man, explains how he can pick up money for the damaged vehicle. As an aside to the reader, the soldier happily mentions that the money is likely going to be enough to purchase a brand-new car. The old man shakes the soldier's hand and says, through an interpreter, "I never expected an American soldier to keep his promise." The two men then chat for a while, discussing everything from politics to sports. They even show each other photos of their loved ones. As the soldier prepares to leave, the old man says, "You are a good man; you have the kindest eyes I have known in my life." The soldier is moved and in his blog he sums up the whole event by writing, "In the middle of this ghetto in some no-name neighborhood in the backwoods of a city in northern Iraq, two men met and became friends."
