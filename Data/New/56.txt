Earthquakes are caused by the continuous movements of the Earth's crust. As continents expand and drift, immense pressures build up along the continental fault lines. The more pressure that builds up, the greater the magnitude of the earthquake when it finally strikes. The strength of an earthquake is measured using the Richter scale. Large earthquakes, which are 6.0 or higher on the Richter scale, often result in vast amounts of damage. Falling buildings, landslides, rockfalls, and tsunamis can all result from this tremendous shaking of the Earth. Because Taiwan straddles a large number of fault lines, it is extremely vulnerable to earthquakes. The effects of the Hengchun earthquake were felt throughout Asia in late 2006 when it damaged Chunghwa Telecom underwater cables and cut off communications. This quake was a harsh reminder of the 7.3 magnitude Chi-Chi earthquake which shook Taiwan on September 21, 1999. More than 2,400 people lost their lives and over 11,000 were injured in this monumental disaster. Many became homeless, as more than 40,000 homes were completely destroyed, and another 40,000 badly damaged. Though cities have been rebuilt, the nation is still recovering from the memory of this horrific event. Though nothing can be done to prevent earthquakes, there are ways to minimize damage and avoid loss of life. Scientists are constantly devising ways to predict them more accurately. Buildings are engineered to minimize earth quake damage, absorbing energy with their flexible steel beams. In high-risk areas, people are taught how to prepare for the next big one. As technology and preparedness education improve, hopefully earthquakes will one day lose their "disaster" classification.
