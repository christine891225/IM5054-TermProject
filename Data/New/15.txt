Since the early 1990s, the lithium-ion battery has been the most suitable battery for portable electronic equipment. Today, they’re commonly used for cellphones, computers, tablets, digital cameras, and other devices. Lithium-ion batteries have nearly twice the energy density of traditional nickel cadmium batteries. That is, they carry more power in a smaller unit, helping to reduce overall weight and size. This feature has important implications for cellphones and computers, because it makes these items more portable for consumers. It also makes power tools easier to use and allows workers to use them for longer periods of time. The lithium-ion battery is also a low maintenance battery. Lithium-ion batteries retain no “memory” of their power capacity from previous charging cycles. Thus they require no scheduled cycling and can be fully re-fueled to their maximum capacity during each charging cycle. Other rechargeable battery types, in contrast, retain information from previous charging cycles, which wastes valuable storage space. Over time, this makes these rechargeable batteries hold less of a charge. Despite its overall advantages, the lithium-ion battery has its drawbacks. It is fragile and requires a protection circuit to maintain safe operation. A high load could overheat the pack and safety might be jeopardized. Another downside is the increase of the internal resistance that occurs with cycling and aging. After 2-3 years of use, the pack often becomes unserviceable due to a large voltage drop caused by high internal resistance. It should be noted, however, that manufacturers are constantly making improvements on lithium-ion batteries. New and enhanced chemical combinations are introduced every six months or so. With such rapid progress, the use of lithium-ion batteries will certainly expand further.
