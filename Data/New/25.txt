Taiwan's pet market is booming. On average, Taiwanese households are taking in just over 2.5 million puppies and kittens a year, representing an annual growth in pet ownership upwards of 10 percent-a number that far outpaces the annual human birth rate of 1.5 percent. Taiwanese nowadays are simply more likely to play parent to their "furry kids" instead of having children of their own. Seizing the opportunity created by this population shift, vendors have begun crowding the floors of Taiwan's numerous pet shows. In fact, the total number of booths at these shows is nearly doubling each year.
Along with this increase in attendance at pet shows, a tide of increasingly sophisticated products and services has also hit Taiwan. In one striking example, Taiwanese pet owners can now join cognitive communication courses, which promise to give them insight into the inner workings of their little bundles of joy. These same pet owners also make use of tailored diet
programs and exercise routines to keep their pets in tip-top shape. Enrollment in pet-only kindergartens is even becoming popular. Here, their little ones are provided with exclusive learning environments, play spaces, and professional behavioral training.
Taiwan is not the only hotspot for this growing market, however. Pet products and services are attracting corporate attention on a global level. For example, companies all over the world are racing to join the industry of high-end pet health care, which is growing speedily. In the leisure and travel industries, major hotel chains are starting to provide pet-friendly amenities. Even dog walking services are seeing a flood of investment. All in all, the thriving pet economy is turning out to be a golden business opportunity for companies willing to get their paws wet. As a result, Taiwan's pet industry is predicted to keep growing over the coming years.
