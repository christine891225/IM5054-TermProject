Student attitudes, teaching styles, and social values tend to differ quite a bit between Eastern and Western cultures. For instance, students in Eastern cultures tend to put stock in discipline and effort. They believe that hard work can overcome academic difficulty, and that failure must be a result of not trying hard enough. Western students, however, do not emphasize effort as much. (1)
It is not just student attitudes that differ. Teaching styles contrast as well. (2) There is not much opportunity for debate. What the teacher says goes, so students don't express as many of their own ideas as their more direct Western counterparts, whose classrooms are more geared toward group discussion and participation. In Western education, curiosity, creativity, and critical thinking are considered very
important skills.
These three skills go hand in hand with the West's more individualist society, which is defined by ideas of freedom and democracy. Western students are highly focused on individual goals. They view education as a means to accomplish these goals and improve their lives. (3) Eastern students are often motivated by gaining knowledge to make their family proud.
While these education styles are very different and may produce different characters, they certainly both have their own benefits. (4) By studying how other cultures do things, we can develop a better understanding of ourselves.
