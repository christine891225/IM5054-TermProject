In 2015, a disturbing video of a sea turtle suffering from a plastic straw stuck in its nose went viral, changing many viewers' attitudes toward the plast1C tool that is largely a convenience for most people. But how can the plastic straw¡Xa diminutive item used briefly before being thrown away¡Xcause so much damage? For starters, it easily finds its way into oceans due to its lightweight nature. (1) Instead, it slowly fragments into smaller and smaller pieces known as microplastics, which are frequently mistaken for food by marine animals. Secondly, it can't be recycled. (2) As a result, they end up in landfills and waterways and, eventually, the oceans, endangering millions of seabirds and marine mammals. In the United States, millions of plastic straws are disposed of each day, and hotels are some of the worst offenders. For example, Hilton Waikoloa Village in Hawaii used more than 800,000 straws in 2017. (3) Some cities in the U.S. are banning them, and some countries are limiting single-use plastic items, which include straws. Belize, Taiwan, and England are among the latest countries to propose bans. (4) Soneva banned straws in 2008, and Cayuga has been using bamboo straws since 2010. Hotels like these have paved the way for a movement, and the travel and hospitality industries are finally starting to catch on. Some cruise lines and tour companies are working toward reducing or eliminating their use of plastic straws on their ships. Hospitality brands eliminating plastic straws have looked to various disposable alternatives. (5) Another choice is compostable straws made from materials like cornstarch. And some establishments are using actual straw as straws, just like when straws first came into use.
