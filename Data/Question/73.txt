With the implementation of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, wild claims on labels of worthless medicines are much less frequent than they were years ago. But some over-the-counter drugs are still being promoted by all tall stories, sometimes told in booklets or through advertising, rather on the label. (1) This isn 't so. Vitamins and minerals are plentiful in our food supply. Eating a variety of foods makes it almost certain that you will get a full quota of these nutrients. Infants, pregnant women, the sick or convalescent, and those who are dieting may need special supplements. But the family physician is the best authority on what vitamin supplements are needed. If your doctor does recommend supplements, take the suggested dose¡Xno more. (2) Excessive doses of certain vitamins are known to be toxic. If you are overweight, don't fall for a formula that promises you a slim, trim figure without dieting or calorie counting. (3) The energy-producing or heat-producing value of food is measured in calories. One Calorie is the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of one kilogram of water one degree centigrade. (4) If you need to lose only a few pounds, you can probably work out your own diet. But if you need to lose many pounds, have your doctor plan a diet for you. Crash diets can break down your health, not your weight. (5) There are no quick or easy cures for acne. Acne is a complex disease caused by a combination of factors. No creams from a drugstore can cure it. Therefore, next time when you shop again in the drugstore, be careful with those wild claims.
