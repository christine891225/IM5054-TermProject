Much ink has been spilled on the question of human hairlessness. (1) Per square centimeter of human skin, there are as many hair follicles as that of other great apes. The difference is that human hair is finer. The possible function of fine body hair has been found by Isabelle Dean and Michael Siva Jothy from Sheffield University in Britain. (2) They tested the idea that fine body hair is there to alert their owner to biting creepy crawlies and give them more time to react before being bitten. (3) Each of them had a patch of skin on one arm shaved, and a corresponding unshaven patch on the other. Then a bug was put on one of the skin patches. The participants were required to record the number of times that they perceived the insect moving on their skin. The difference turned out to be significant. When a bug was on a hairy patch, it was detected every 4 seconds on average while it took more than 10 seconds on a shaven patch. (4) As men were hairier in terms of follicles density and the length of hair, they were less bitten than women when a bug was released on the unshaven area. Whatever reason human body hair has shrunk for, there is at least one purpose for it to stay. (5)
