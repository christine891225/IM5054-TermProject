Bees, particularly honeybees, have been around for millions of years and are responsible for pollinating over a third of our supply and 90% of wild plants. Pollination is the key step in the reproduction of many plants. (1) They are so essential in crop pollination that some farmers ¡§rent¡¨ them or ship them in to pollinate their crops in the spring. For years, however, the honeybee population has been decreasing, which poses a major threat to global agriculture and our future. According to the research of Wageningen University in the U.S., if one day bees should go extinct, 10% of our world food production would be lost. (2) Besides, the amount of variation in our food would also decrease. What¡¦s more, people would lack many vitamins and minerals because bees could help spread such nutrients in our food. (3) There are a lot to be discussed by experts. One is changes in agriculture. Over the years, farmers have used weed killers and cultivate monocultures that cover a huge amount of agriculture area. Thus, bees have fewer and fewer options to feed and pollinate. (4) Farmers use pesticides to minimize the damage to the plants, causing a lower level of nectar and pollen in a plant. And bees with a low dose of pesticides can¡¦t find their way back to the hive. Still other causes include habitat loss, climate change, increased disease incidence, and so on. In reality, the multiple causes make it harder to do something about what¡¦s called Colony Collapse Disorder¡Xa phenomenon that occurs when the majority of worker bees in a colony disappear.    (5) However, we humans still need to try our best to solve the problem¡Xto save the honeybees. Otherwise we may really face less food production and limited food access one day.
