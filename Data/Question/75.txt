Direct-trade chocolate is where the chocolate makers, often in Europe or the USA, form direct relationships with the cacao farmers in the tropics, from areas such as South America, Africa and Indonesia. Direct-trade often pays much more than fair trade prices. The chocolate maker now works closely with the farmer. (1) The idea is to stop treating the cacao as just a farm product but to acknowledge and nurture the quality and richness of this wonderful plant. There is also the desire to make great tasting chocolate. The concept of direct-trade was pioneered by the American coffee shop owner, Jim Stewart, in the late 1970's, in the coffee bean trade. (2) Direct-trade coffee really grew in the 1990's and early 21st century. It was adopted by a number of top coffee roasters in the USA and Britain. This method was later followed by a number of chocolate makers in Europe and USA. They could see the benefits of this technique to improve the quality of cacao. (3) They also wish to strengthen the local communities as many of the chocolate growers are from very poor areas. Good cacao farmers are now seen as craftsman and are rewarded for their quality offering. (4) Through the direct trade relationship, modern farming techniques and other resources are also provided to help assist the farmer. The end result of this whole process is that direct-trade chocolate is more expensive. (5) They have a higher cost structure than the larger supermarket chocolate companies. Thankfully, today there is now a variety of ethically produced, beautifully tasting direct-trade chocolate available.
