When Sean Aiken graduated from business school, he began looking for a job. But Sean was ambitious- he did not just look for one job. (1) Sean was trying to get as much job-related experience as he could to help him decide on a career. In order to achieve this, Sean was willing to travel to any place where someone would hire him. (2) One of the reasons for this was that Sean planned to donate all of the money he made to charity. Sean managed to acquire quite a variety of experiences. (3) Then he went on to work as a pizza maker, an advertising executive, and a cowboy. He
even got to work with the Canadian Air Force. (4) Bringing things around full circle, Sean finished his adventure as mayor of his hometown in British Colombia, Canada. Not only did Sean learn a lot from the experience, he also inspired countless others. (5) Sean's experiences encouraged them to think about following their passions rather than simply doing what pays the bills. After 52 weeks and 52 jobs, Sean finally managed to narrow down his search. Check out Sean's story online at www.oneweekjob.com.
