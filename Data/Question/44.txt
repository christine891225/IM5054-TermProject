In the thirteenth century, the Mongol Empire stretched across the continents of Asia and Europe. Its leader, Genghis Khan, conquered cities from Beijing to Vienna by employing terrifying weapons such as catapults and burning oil. (1) Genghis and the other Mongols needed woks to prepare hot pot, their favorite dish. Since these warriors were always on the move, their cooking tools needed to be easy to carry, and their food needed to be prepared quickly. (2) They cut the meats into very thin slices so that they would cook quickly and use less fuel. Genghis's personal hot pot was prepared using a secret recipe that called for over sixty different medicinal herbs. (3) But more than that, the Mongol leader believed that his nightly hot pots would allow him to live forever. (4) Mongolian influence brought hot pot to all corners of Asia, and today there are dozens of varieties of the desert wok. (5) Today, while sipping warm broth from steaming pots, we can still get a taste of the Mongol warrior's success.
