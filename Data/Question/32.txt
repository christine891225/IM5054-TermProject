Everyone knows that sleep is important, but have you ever wondered why? What exactly happens while we sleep, and how can we get better sleep? Sleep is a complex process that affects practically every system of our bodies. While asleep, we go through several sleep cycles that include two main types of sleep: non-REM (NREM) sleep and REM sleep. (1) During this type of sleep, our brain waves, breathing, and heart rate slow down, and we stay mostly still. During REM sleep, however, brain waves are fast, breathing and heart rate are irregular, and
our muscles jerk involuntarily. (2) Conversely, a lack of sleep has been linked to a range of health problems. People who don't get enough shut-eye are at a higher risk of obesity, depression, anxiety, and more. It's clear that sleep is necessary for maintaining good health.
Adults need seven to nine hours of sleep per night, and consistency is crucial. Having a set bedtime and wake-up time has been proven to be best for your health. (3) To help you fall asleep, develop a relaxing bedtime routine. Stop eating (and drinking in large quantities) about three hours before bed. (4) Besides getting enough sleep, you'll also want to get good quality sleep. Light affects sleep, so keep your bedroom as dark as possible. Another common sleep disruption is noise, so if you're a light sleeper, try earplugs or a white noise machine. With any luck, learning about sleep hasn't put you to sleep. But even if it did, getting enough Z's is one of the best things that you can do for your health!
