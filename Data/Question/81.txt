Laser means ¡§light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation.¡¨ A laser is an object that produces beams of light which can travel very long distances. (1) The first lasers were developed in the 1950s by American and Russian scientists. (2) At that time lasers existed purely in science fiction, devised by writers like HG Wells. In his novel War of the Worlds, for example, he wrote about Martians who had a weapon called a heat ray. Normal light consists of many wavelengths and colors. Laser light, in contrast, does not scatter but moves in the same direction. (3) When electrons move from a lower level to a higher level around an atom, they emit a photon, a particle of light. After that, they tend to fall back to their original orbit. Nowadays, lasers are used in many situations in different areas of life. (4) They also act as instruments, when exact measurements are needed. Therefore you can find lasers in various medical instruments in hospitals. Lasers can also produce 3D images. Modern medicine uses lasers to destroy tumors in human body or to correct eyesight. (5) They use lasers to remove damaged tissue from a patient¡¦s body without destroying the cells around it. Living in a world where lasers have been widely applied to different aspects of life, we may start to ponder over where, when, and how we can use them to an extreme degree for the welfare of all humans.
