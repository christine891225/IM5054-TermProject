More than 1.3 billion tons of food is wasted globally each year. Sadly, a lot of this food is still edible when it's thrown out. This is a waste of the many resources used in food production, including land, water, energy, and transportation. What if there were a way to cut down on food waste? A UK start-up called Mimica might have come up with one. (1) Mimic has developed high-tech food labels that can indicate whether products are fresh. The company's touch indicators come as either flat labels that can be placed on food products or used as bottle caps for drinks. (2) All a consumer has to do is run a finger over the label or cap. If it is smooth, the product is fresh. If it is bumpy, the product is spoiled. Mimica isn't the only group working to find solutions to food waste. (3) The label, called "Barcodiscount", helps prevent food waste while also assisting stores in dealing with inventory. Supermarkets and other stores lower prices on food products as they near their expiration dates. However, changing price tags by hand is difficult and time-consuming. The Barcodiscount labels solve this problem. (4) For example, 48 hours before a product's expiration date, the label's color can change to reveal the message "20% off." The timing and price are set using software, and it's all automatic, which can help prevent mistakes. By taking some of the guesswork out of food freshness, perhaps smart labels can help curb the growing problem of food waste.
