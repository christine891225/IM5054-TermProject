One summer afternoon in 1840, the Duchess of Bedford was starving. The morning meal was long gone, and dinner was still hours away. (1) This was the very first afternoon tea, and among the treats prepared for her was the humble scone. This sweet, baked good, or variations of it, is now enjoyed with coffee or tea in countries around the world. The word scone dates back to 1513. Most language experts believe it originates from Scottish Gaelic. Indeed, the first scones are believed to have been created in Scotland. (2) Later on, the introduction of baking powder led to the smaller, oven-baked scones we see today.
Modern scones start with dough made from flour, egg, baking powder, milk, and butter. Scones are traditionally sweet, though they can also be savory depending on what else you include. Cheese is quite common, as are raisins. (3) For instance, in England, if you're having a classic English cream tea, it will include a plain scone with cream and jam. In Scotland, potato scones are eaten with breakfast, while people in the United States are more likely to eat biscuits-a type of savory scone. (4) As mentioned, American biscuits are usually savory, and they are often used in fast-food breakfast sandwiches. Many people grab a sausage, egg, and cheese biscuit on their morning drive to work.
Scones can obviously be enjoyed in many forms. But no matter how you prefer them, everyone can agree on one thing: the best scone is served fresh and hot, straight from the oven.
