His name is Bond. James Bond. He is a British spy Agent 007. (1) Using expensive vehicles, high-tech gadgets, incredible combat skills, and uncanny luck, Bond has saved the world several times while seducing women in almost every country on Earth. But James Bond is more than just some purely fictional character. (2) During World War II, Fleming, like Bond, was in the British Intelligence service. He created an information-gathering unit trained in safe-cracking, lock-picking, unarmed combat, and other spy techniques. Fleming planned several successful raids, and it was this environment of secrets and international espionage that gave the background for the creation of James Bond. Bond is widely considered to be a romanticized version of Fleming himself. Both the author and character enjoy drinking and smoking, they have similar educational backgrounds and careers, and both men have risen through the military ranks to commander. (3) We see a less experienced and more vulnerable Bond in the 21st Bond film, Casino Rovale. (4) His mission: to spy on a man who plans to raise money from a high-stakes poker game to fund the world's terrorist organizations. Casino Royale, like most Bond stories, was inspired by true events. During World War II, Fleming spent time at a Portuguese casino. His card game of choice, chemin de fer, was the same as Bond's. (Though this was changed to Texas hold'em in the movie.) (5) Though Fleming eventually got married and died at an early age, James Bond will continue to live Fleming's extravagant life in films to come.
