Architects design new buildings and oversee work when old buildings are renewed. Carrie Jeffers is an architect whose job is making old buildings look like new. (1) In today’s cities, many old buildings are in need of repair. Sometimes bathrooms, kitchens, and electric wiring need replacing. Underneath, though, these houses are sturdy. If they could be fixed, many more people of the city would have good homes. (2) As a young girl Carrie saw many beautiful old buildings and went to many museums. When Carrie was in college, she worked as a letter carrier in the small town of Newark, Ohio. (3) One day she said to herself that she could make better houses than the new kind she saw going up. Carrie studied art history in college. (4) When she finished her studies, she found a job with a small company that mainly rehabilitates old houses in the city. She enjoyed working for the company because she got to do many different kinds of jobs. (5) But Carrie says you don’t have to be a great artist or even very good in math to be a good architect. The one talent needed is an ability to see in your mind what a building will look like when it’s finished.
