Twenty kilometers from the severely damaged and exploded nuclear reactors at Fukushima, a giant floating wind turbine is anchored in deep water off the coast. It marks the start of Japan's most ambitious strive for clean energy. With the operation of this 100-meter-tall windmill in November, 2013, it was expected to generate enough electricity to power 1,700 homes. (1) That is equal to the amount of electricity generated by a nuclear reactor. Japan was forced to look for an alternative to nuclear energy after its multiple nuclear meltdowns at Fukushima in 2011. Japan's 50 reactors are all currently down, waiting for inspections. It is looking more seriously at renewable power. The windmill project's advocates say that offshore windmills could be a breakthrough for this energy-poor country. The leaders of the country have been striving to make the best of what they are blessed with. (2) The project is also a bid to take the initiative in an industry expected to double over the next five years to a global capacity of 536 gigawatts. What sets the project apart from other offshore wind farms around the world is that its turbines float on giant platforms anchored to the seabed. (3) However, a professor at Tokyo University reminded, "We shouldn't forget the obvious reality check." The farther from the coast they place these floating wind farms, the more expensive it becomes to build them and transmit the power back to the inland. (4) They have not been able to fish since the 311 disaster and fear that the project will deprive them of their fishing grounds. Durability is another big issue. (5) In the meanwhile, it acknowledges no one is certain how long, or how well, the turbines will hold up. But the possible rewards are still exciting. The estimated 20,000 parts used in offshore wind turbines could add billions of yen to Japan's economy.
