Hetty Green was an American female tycoon and, according to the Guinness World Records, the "World's Greatest Miser." (1) Investing mostly in real estate and railroads, she built up an empire that today would be equal to nearly two billion dollars. Green certainly knew how to handle a dollar, even if by all accounts she was a little bit nutty. (2) Quakers are usually very frugal, but Green was a legendary miser. During her life, she went far beyond what most people, even Quakers, considered acceptable at the time. (3) She lived in cheap apartments in run-down areas of the city, even when she could afford to stay at fancy hotels. In an effort to avoid paying taxes, she even moved to a new state every few months so no state could claim she lived there. Green's personal habits were equally shocking. (4) If she needed it cleaned, she would have only the bottom half done. It's even said that she would boil oatmeal on a radiator rather than pay for a meal in a restaurant. (5) But she was also a remarkable businesswoman. For example she was the first woman to make a major impact on Wall Street. Green may have been an extreme cheapskate, but no other woman at the time could have done what she did.
