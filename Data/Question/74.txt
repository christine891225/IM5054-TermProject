In 2009, the Kenyan government started a scheme to rehouse the residents of the Kibera settlement, one of Africa's largest informal settlements built on unstable land. (1) First, it will help tackle the enduring poverty that exists in informal communities, which in turn will increase the city's economy as people gain formal employment and pay taxes. Second, governments will reclaim the land and nearby city residents will no longer feel that informal settlements impact on the value of their own homes. (2) That is, residents choosing to return to their old community. One reason for this is cost. The new accommodation in Kibera may appear cheap to the outside world at SIO a month. (3) As a result, some residents may choose to stay in the settlement and rent out their new homes to middle-class families at a profit. (4) They offer clean, comfortable accommodation, but they can also take people away from their families, employment, and the community. (5) In addition, when rehousing people it is important that those people are involved in the planning process to ensure that new housing is affordable and a successful community is created. With an estimated growth of two billion in the global population by 2030, it is vital that cities address this issue today in order to prepare for the future.
