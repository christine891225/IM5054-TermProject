Robots have improved tremendously in recent years. But they're still no match for humans, right? Wrong! Imagine you decided to test just how advanced robots have become by challenging them to a baseball game. You'd pick the most sophisticated robots scientists have designed, and put them up against the world's best baseball players. (1) The big hitters on the robots' team would be capable of hitting a fastball traveling at 300 km/h! No human baseball player has ever faced a ball traveling at that speed! (2) The robots would also be capable of catching balls thrown at this speed, using only three fingers! They wouldn't even need baseball mitts! The humans wouldn't stand a chance! (3) The fastest robot can run at only 3 km/h. That doesn't sound very impressive if we consider that the average person can run at 27 km/h. Already, scientists have produced robots that can hit and catch better than any human. (5) Then all they have to do is combine all of these abilities into one machine. Soon, we could be watching robot baseball on TV!
