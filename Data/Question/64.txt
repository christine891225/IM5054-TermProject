It is said that Yuli, Hualien has no litter or homeless people. The legendary story unfolded since 1966, when a French priest, Father Yves Moal, set foot in Yuli. Soon after his arrival, he noticed many local children spent their after-school hours roaming the streets. (1) Their elderly grandparents were the main carers. To provide shelter to these kids, Moal established a reading room near his office. He later went on to create reading spaces in the township of Ruisui as well. (2) In fact, many adults have been pushed to society's margins as well. They have been overlooked as a result of alcoholism, physical or mental disability, or a criminal record. Moal has embraced these people, providing them with food and lodging. (3) When the government commenced promoting recycling, Moal got his flock engaging in it too. His workers are assigned tasks to which they are suited. For example, physically strong individuals are asked to drive to designated locations to collect recyclables. (4) They also help organize still-usable secondhand goods. This ensures that everyone has the opportunity to develop and contribute. Each recycling station also has basic kitchen amenities. Coworkers cook for one another, eating, cracking jokes, and occasionally even sharing their troubles. (5) Coming from different backgrounds, they sometimes argue, and a few fall back into bad habits, but Moal never gives up on any of them. His effort has enabled individuals whom society has abandoned or who have suffered other injuries to find value in their lives.
