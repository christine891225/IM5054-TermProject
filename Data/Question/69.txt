Have you ever wondered how YouTube video makers get paid? Mah-Dry-Bread, a famous YouTuber, put out a video that detailed everything you could possibly need to know about getting paid on YouTube. (1) YouTubers typically work from home, and some make their enfire livelihood by producing content. (2) If you're starting a career on YouTube or you have taken an interest in building up your brand on the site, you need to know the following three best ways to get paid. First, put ads at the beginning of your videos. Viewers will probably watch at least thirty seconds of your video. As long as they don't use an ad blocker, you will earn money. (3) YouTube tallies up the revenue they make from ads and then splits that profit with you. Thirty seconds of the video may not make you any money, but thirty seconds of a preroll ad will. Second, get your videos sponsored. An advertiser will pay you to make a video that introduces or involves their product. Some advertisers pay a fee simply based on how many people watched the video. (4) Third, use Patreon. Patreon enables content creators to receive donations from their fans. The site takes ten percent of the donations, and the creator gets the rest. (5) Mah-Dry-Bread reminds us that YouTubers are putting out free art and that people deserve to have the opportunity to pay for it.
