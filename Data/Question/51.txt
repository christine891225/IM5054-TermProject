Jacuzzis, those bathtubs with bubbles, have long been synonymous with luxury hotels and celebrity homes. (1) The original seven Jacuzzi brothers were Italian immigrants who arrived in America in the early 1900s in search of the American Dream. (2) In the 1920s, they moved into the agricultural pump industry. It was expertise gained in this field that helped in the development of the Jacuzzi whirlpool bath. (3) In the fifties, the son of Candido Jacuzzi, the youngest of the seven brothers, was found to have rheumatoid arthritis. This condition causes great stiffness and pain in the body. To help the young boy, the Jacuzzis produced a portable pump that could be used in a bath of water to massage the body with jets of water. (4) The modern self-contained Jacuzzi whirlpool bath was the invention of Roy Jacuzzi. In 1968, Roy introduced the "Roman Bath," in which the jets were built directly into the bath itself. Roy displayed his invention at fairs and trade shows, and his timing could not have been better. (5) Today, Jacuzzi is the biggest name in whirlpool type baths, and their products are found more and more in the houses of ordinary people.
