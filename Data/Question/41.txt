The tiny home movement is a trend that has been growing across the United States. Followers of this trend choose to live in houses that are about a tenth of the average US home size. The lifestyle was first mentioned in Lester Walker's 1987 book, Tiny, Tiny Houses: or How to Get Away from It All. (1) One of the biggest motivations for trying a tiny home today is the low cost. When the world was hit with an economic recession in 2008, many people found themselves unable to afford regular homes. (2) There are also environmental benefits to living in a tiny home, helping the trend
grow even more. (3) Their small sizes also minimize the amount of land that needs to be cleared for them to sit on. Tiny homes use less power and often run well on solar panels, which is a popular feature for homebuyers today. (4) Most tiny homes are built on wheels, making them easy to tow. For people nervous about being stuck in one place, a tiny home gives them the ability to move whenever they wish without needing to worry about getting a new place. With so much growth, it's clear the tiny home trend will continue for years to come. It's become a popular option for those looking to live a little differently. Who knows where it'Il catch on next?
