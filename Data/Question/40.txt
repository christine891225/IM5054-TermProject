Located on the eastern shore of the Baltic Sea is the small, charming country of Lithuania. (1) Lithuania boasts a rich cultural history. Humans have been living in the region for nearly ten thousand years, and the first record of Lithuania as a country dates back to the year 1009. Touring the capital city, Vilnius, offers visitors scenes of varied architectural styles. (2) Within the city limits is Vilnius Old Town, one of the largest remaining historic old towns in Europe. It houses the fourteenth-century Presidential Palace, the current home and office of the Lithuanian president. Take a winter trip to the highest point in Vilnius, the Hill of Three Crosses, and watch the buildings of Old Town get blanketed by fresh snow. A short distance to the west of Vilnius is the city of Trakai, a popular lake resort town. Here, visitors can relax at one of the two hundred lakes in the area. (3) Locals dress in frightening costumes, dance, and eat a traditional festival food: pancakes! If one feels like escaping the festivities and spending some time in nature, Lithuania certainly lends itself to that too. (4) Or they can spend time in Zemaitija National Park, which offers a secret attraction: a tour of a former nuclear missile base! Indeed, it's often Lithuania's largely overlooked places that draw lucky travelers to this exceptional country.
