If you follow tennis at all, you've probably heard of Roger Federer. (1) After winning a match against up-and-coming Stefanos Tsitsipas, he became the second player of the modern era to have claimed one hundred tournament titles. Over his career, Federer has developed a versatile playing style that has allowed him to prevail on all courts. By the numbers, this tennis wonder is very likely the finest player yet.
Federer has topped the ATP (Association of Tennis Professionals) rankings for a record 310 weeks and has taken home 20 Grand Slam singles titles. (2) His mastery of the sport has made him no less than a living legend. Nevertheless, there have been moments in which Federer has found himself at a disadvantage. In 2013, he suffered a serious back injury. Then, in 2016, he blew out his knee, requiring him to undergo surgery and skip much of that season. (3) Twice, and against all odds, he returned from the brink, climbed back up the rankings, and reasserted himself as the player to beat.
(4) Through the Roger Federer Foundation, he has collaborated with nonprofit organizations in Switzerland and South Africa, his adopted homeland, to promote extracurricular activities in poor areas. Having set the goal of supporting one million children by the organization's fifteenth anniversary, Federer has followed through and smashed that target. As a philanthropist, brand ambassador, and tennis player, Roger Federer has consistently proven himself to be in a class of his own.
