Earthquakes are caused by the continuous movements of the Earth's crust. As continents expand and drift, immense pressures build up along the continental fault lines. (1) The strength of an earthquake is measured using the Richter scale. Large earthquakes, which are 6.0 or higher on the Richter scale, often result in vast amounts of damage. (2) Because Taiwan straddles a large number of fault lines, it is extremely vulnerable to earthquakes. (3) This quake was a harsh reminder of the 7.3 magnitude Chi-Chi earthquake which shook Taiwan on September 21, 1999. More than 2,400 people lost their lives and over 11,000 were injured in this monumental disaster. (4) Though cities have been rebuilt, the nation is still recovering from the memory of this horrific event. Though nothing can be done to prevent earthquakes, there are ways to minimize damage and avoid loss of life. Scientists are constantly devising ways to predict them more accurately. (5) In high-risk areas, people are taught how to prepare for the next big one. As technology and preparedness education improve, hopefully earthquakes will one day lose their "disaster" classification.
