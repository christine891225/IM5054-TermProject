A bloody nose can be irritating and also frightening for people who do not get them frequently. (1) If a nosebleed persists for more than half an hour or is the result of serious trauma such as a blow to the face, however, the patient should seek professional medical attention. In addition, frequent bloody noses can be a sign of a health problem, and they should be addressed by a doctor as well. (2) While ice can restrict the blood vessels slightly, it does not work as well as pinching the nose. For younger patients, however, an ice pack can be a distraction from the nosebleed, and it can make the experience less scary. Medications and herbal mixes may not always stop nosebleeds either, and they can in fact increase irritation to the nose, so they should be avoided. (3) Then, tilt your head slightly forward and pinch the soft tissue of your nose, holding your nose shut for around 15 minutes. If your nose continues bleeding after you release it, repeat the process once. (4) These techniques to stop nosebleeds should not, however, be attempted at home, as it is possible to damage the delicate tissue of the nose with inexperience. Several things are important to keep in mind when you stop nosebleeds. The first is that the nose should be elevated above the heart, reducing the amount of blood flow to the nose. (5) In addition, you want to avoid swallowing the blood, as this can cause intestinal upset. Leaning forward will allow the blood to drain out the nose and mouth, and patients should be given a basin to spit into so that blood will not trickle down their throats.
