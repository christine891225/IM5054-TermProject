The Kanji of the Year selection is an annual event in Japan. Each December, one kanji, or written character, is chosen by members of the Japanese Kanji Proficiency Society to represent the year that has passed. (1) Part of the event involves the head monk of a famous temple in Kyoto writing the choice out with traditional brush and ink. The monk was far from enthusiastic about 2007's choice, however. (2) But even if nise hadn't won out, he would probably have been no happier about having to write the runners-up. (3) The choice of such negative-meaning kanji reflected public outrage over a series of scandals. One of these involved corrupt cabinet ministers while another centered on food companies using "fake" production dates. Happily, the 2008 Kanji of the Year, hen, meaning "change," reflected a slightly more positive attitude. One of the main influences on its selection was the election of the new US President, Barack Obama. Apart from symbolizing a dramatic change of power, the kanji also echoed Obama's campaign slogan, "Change You Can Believe In." (4) These two years saw successive Japanese prime ministers resign. And, of course, 2008 was an Olympic year. This was reflected by the second most popular kanji, kin, or "gold." (5) The Japanese public hopes that this year will be deserving of a positive kanji.
