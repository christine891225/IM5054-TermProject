For a long time, environmentalists have expressed concern over the use of plastics in product packaging. This is because plastics generally create a lot of waste. (1) If those chemicals entered the food chain, through soil or water, the results would be terrible. (2) The plastic, called PHBV, is made from plant matter. It has been developed by six universities working together in Taiwan. (3) Best of all, it can be quickly reduced to just water and one other chemical, which doesn't harm nature. The raw material for PHBV is made by letting bacteria feed on rice and soy milk. The entire process is completely safe. Moreover, a discarded PHBV bottle would break down completely in about a week. This is very significant when you consider that 200 million tons of plastic are produced each year. Therefore, switching to PHBV could relieve an enormous burden on the environment. PHBV is not the only environmentally friendly plastic out there. (4) In fact, it can be produced for half the cost of its nearest rival.
Nevertheless, PHBV isn't perfect. For one thing, it must be broken down at a special industrial unit. (5) However, with pollution from traditional plastics manufacturing such a serious problem, PHBV is definitely a step in the right direction.
