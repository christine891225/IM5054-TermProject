A young king by the name of Admetus was well known throughout his kingdom for his kindness and generosity. One day, a beggar arrived at his gate looking for work. (1) The beggar was actually the god Apollo in disguise. In return, he promised to help Admetus should he ever need it.
Not long after, Admetus fell in love with a woman from a neighboring kingdom, a fair and compassionate princess known as Alcestis. Admetus visited Alcestis's father to ask for her hand in marriage. Her father agreed to Admetus's proposal under one condition: he must leave and return in a chariot pulled by a lion and a wild boar. (2) Apollo agreed, and the two lovers were soon married in a joyous celebration.
Many came to the wedding bearing gifts, but the most valuable was an assurance given by Apollo himself. (3) Years passed, and while the love between Admetus and Alcestis deepened, the once-young king eventually became critically ill. Admetus's loved ones searched for someone willing to die for him, but no one was willing to give up their life. On realizing this, Alcestis retired to her chambers, where she lay down and closed her eyes. Suddenly, the king's health began to improve. (4) He wept bitterly, and as he did, the color slowly returned to Alcestis's cheeks. Alcestis had met the goddess Persephone in the underworld, who had been so moved by Alcestis's sacrifice that she restored her life. The couple spent their remaining years happily together, grateful for the god's help.
