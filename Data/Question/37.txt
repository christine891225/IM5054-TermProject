The spread of COVID-19 has prompted many nations to take away their citizens' freedom of movement. People must stay at home as schools and businesses close down and normal life is put on hold. (1) But how? In order to keep the right to freedom of movement, citizens of these countries have sacrificed a different kind of right- the right to privacy.
For instance, in Taiwan, if anyone reports to a hospital with COVID-19 symptoms, their recent movements are traced using mobile phone data so that people who have come into contact with them can be notified. (2) Local authorities can also track the cell phones of persons in quarantine in order to ensure they are quarantining correctly. While this kind of tracking could potentially be viewed as an invasion of privacy, most citizens have been happy to comply if it means that life continues as normal and deaths remain low. (3) Many people do not trust their governments to use their data responsibly. Some worry that invasive surveillance measures will outlast COVID-19 and become the new norm, or that hackers will exploit important data. Western countries have, by and large, avoided the use of contact tracing apps and surveillance technology. (4) In the age of the coronavirus crisis, one thing is for sure: the delicate balance between freedom and public health is a complex issue, and one that will likely continue beyond the pandemic.
