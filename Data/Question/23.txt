Each year, something amazing happens that spans the African continent. (1) This amazing journey is the greatest known mass movement of mammals in the world.
Beginning in October, straw-colored fruit bats, the second largest bat species in Africa, begin to descend on Zambian Kasanka National Park. These large bats, with wingspans near to one meter in length, continue to arrive in the area until mid-November, and then eventually return to their areas of origin by the end of December.
While at Kasanka, they spend their time feasting on the local fruit and berries that ripen at that time of year. (2) That's close to six tons of total fruit eaten by the colony!
Researchers still aren't completely sure why all of these bats come to this one place, though. It is clear they come from different countries, but it's unknown how or why they all chose this place to travel to. The area is so small that they must hang much closer together on branches than they normally prefer. (3) However, it has been found that the majority of female bats that travel to Kasanka are pregnant, so it may be that they come to eat and gain enough energy to grow healthy young.
Despite the reasons for the meeting remaining unclear, it's certainly one of the world's rarest events. (4) Kasanka Park is certainly a special place with a great natural treasure.
