With an idea in mind, Kyle MacDonald started an online project in 2005 to see how much he could get in trade for a red paperclip. His dream was to continue trading until he had a house. (1) MacDonald¡¦s first trade happened two days later, when he received a fish pen in return for his red paperclip. (2) Things he got included such as a snowmobile, a van, a recording contract, and a fully-furnished rent-free apartment for one year. He never held on to any of the items, though. (3) When he got that offer, Kyle was really tempted to stop his project and spend time with his rock idol. (4) After making 14 trades, Kyle was able to make a trade for a house. Despite all the wonderful things Kyle was offered, he says that the most important trade was his very first one. That red paperclip represented an idea. (5) An idea will never be more than an idea¡Xif you don¡¦t have the courage to follow your dreams.
