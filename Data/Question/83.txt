Asia's first Legoland theme park opened in Malaysia on September 15, 2012. Legoland Malaysia is located in the city of Johor Bahru in the southern tip of Peninsula Malaysia near the border with Singapore. (1) The theme park is 76 acres of adventure, featuring a variety of rides and thousands of Lego models made out of the popular toy bricks. (2) Its cluster of attractions are expected to transform the sleepy region into a thriving tourist hub. The theme park is packed with more than 40 rides, shows and attractions. Most rides are for children under the age of 12, but the theme park also has a variety of attractions for the whole family like the "4D Lego Studios." There is something for everyone in the theme park, young and old alike. (3) The main highlight of the park is Miniland. On a scale of 1:20, famous Asian towns and landscapes have been recreated from over 30 million LEGO bricks. (4) To make Miniland as realistic as possible, people, animals, cars, ships, trains and airplanes can be moved at the touch of a button together with the appropriate background noises.Legoland Malaysia is the sixth Legoland theme park in the world, after those in Denmark, Britain, Germany and Florida and California in the United States. With 40 interactive rides and attractions, it is hoped that the park will attract more than 1.5 million people a year.
