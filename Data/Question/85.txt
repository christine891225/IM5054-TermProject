Ramadan is celebrated annually by Muslims around the world. (1) The month lasts between 29 and 30 days based upon the first sighting of the crescent moon. This annual practice is considered one of the Five Pillars of Islam. Fasting, an integral part of the observance is compulsory for Muslims once they reach puberty. (2) In most cases, people will not allow illness to get in the way of celebrating Ramadan. Thus, healthcare professionals will be needed to closely monitor their patients who decide to persist with fasting. Fasting begins at dawn each day and lasts till sunset. During the day, Muslims refrain from eating, drinking, smoking and sexual relations. This allows them to emphasize the religious side of their lives. (3) At sunset, families canpartake of a fast-breaking meal. (4) Ramadan also teaches Muslims how to better practice self-discipline, self-control, sacrifice, and empathy for those who are less fortunate. During Ramadan, a sense of good will toward their fellow people permeates the holiday, since charity is very important in Islam, and even more soduring Ramadan. (5) Ramadan is indeed a time of spiritual reflection, worship and introspection.
