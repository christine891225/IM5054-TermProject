When is the last time you listened to music? These days, it's easy to open an app on your smartphone and listen to whatever song you please with the simple tap of a screen. However, listening to your favorite tunes hasn't always been so effortless. Audio technology has come a long way since Thomas Edison invented the first music playing device in 1877-the phonograph. (1) Following the phonograph came the gramophone, created ten years later by the German-American inventor Emile Berliner. This device played grooved, flat disks made of glass that became the foundation for the popular vinyl records of the 1940s. Music listening in the twentieth century was largely dominated by these vinyl record players, along with radio broadcasting. (2) Other portable devices followed, including the boom box of the 1970s, as well as the Walkman and Discman of the 1980s. MP3 players were also introduced in the late 1990s and early 2000s. This market was later taken by storm by Apple's iPod device.

Wireless listening enabled by Bluetooth technology is also quite popular, doing away with the wired headphones of earlier decades. However, not all technology from the past has been forgotten. (4) One might say the evolution of music formats has come full circle-just like records themselves.
