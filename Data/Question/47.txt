Do you notice anything unusual about the following sentence? I'm curious how quickly you can find out what is so unusual about this. It's actually missing the most common letter in the English language: E. (1) It's far from easy to write a paragraph without a common letter in it. (2) Among the more famous are Ernest Wright's Gadsby and Georges Perec's La Disparition. Both works omit the letter E. Working without the letter E is a favorite lipogram challenge because its commonness makes it the hardest letter to leave out. (3) Gyles Brandreth, for example, rewrote some of Shakespeare's plays. In his version, Brandreth changed Hamlet's famous line, "To be or not to be, that is the question," to, "To be or not to be, that's the query." (4) Those who guessed the letter I take the prize. The challenge of omitting a single letter is not enough for some writers, however. Mike Schertzer, for example, limited himself to the letters found in the sentence, "Who can find me here in this silence?" (5) Lipograms certainly present an interesting challenge for writers. For the reader, though, once you've discovered which letters are not being used, the appeal of the book can quickly fade.
