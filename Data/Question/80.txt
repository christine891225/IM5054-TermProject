As a resident of Taipei City and a bike lover I have to commend the city's effort to launch the so-called "U-Bike" rental system, which has been expanded to a wider portion of the city. (1) Currently the system has been expanded to many MRT stations, as well as areas surrounding National Taiwan University. Bicycling through the NTU campus can be a relaxing and escaping experience after working in a tense and grueling work environment. The renting process is as simple as it gets. You can either rent as a member of the U-Bike system or on a pay-as-you-go basis. (2) For this reason I recommend the first option. All you need to do is sign up to become a member at the U-Bike website, www.youbike.com.tw. Then, if you have a Taipei Easy Card, find the serial number at the lower right corner and enter that number. Each member can have up to five cards under his or her name. (3) The rental fee is NT$IO per 30 minutes. You can return the bike at any rental station you want. Just remember to point the East Card at the system again to have the fee deducted from the card. (4) This means, if you "check out" a U-bike in less than half an hour, you're basically getting a free ride, faster than all the other means of transport ¡X as well as getting a good workout. (5) Once you get started, I guarantee you will get addicted to it. I suggest all residents of this great city should try using this system whenever possible. Let's work together to keep our city clean and green.
