Researchers have been searching for cures for diseases for centuries. Great strides have been made in medicine in the last fifty years, and one of the major improvements has been in the area of regenerative medicine. (1) Though still in its experimental stages, regenerative medicine has the potential to alleviate suffering and treat many diseases. (2) During an illness or injury, healthy cells are destroyed. In the case of leukemia, the effects of chemotherapy ravage the healthy cells. (3) These new cells set to work healing and repairing the body. (4) They injected the stem cells into a rodent with tumors. Within days, the newly injected stem cells shrank the tumors by 80 percent. Outside of the lab, Korean researchers are reporting a human victory in their research. (5) As a result, she can now walk on her own. Prior to the treatment, she hadn't stood in 19 years.
