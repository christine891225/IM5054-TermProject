By now, everyone knows climate change is a major threat to the planet. (1) However, global warming has already begun to affect some of our favorite foods and drinks. This may serve as a wake-up call for many, forcing us to change our diets
sooner rather than later. Lots of people like to start their day with coffee, but rising temperatures may put a stop to this habit. In many coffee-growing regions, warmer weather has caused fungus to spread among coffee plants, while making some areas too hot for the plants to grow at all. (2) Cocoa plants cannot grow in high temperatures. If the climate continues warming at the current pace, cocoa plants could totally die out by the year 2050.
Climate change doesn't just affect the foods and drinks we enjoy as treats; it also affects crops that people rely on to survive. More than four billion people rely on just wheat, corn, and rice as their main food sources. (3) The chickpea is another important crop at risk because it is particularly sensitive to drought. It is the main protein source for one-fifth of the world. Seafood is another major source of protein for the world. But sadly, warming oceans and higher CO levels are resulting in the decrease of fish populations. Every year, the amount of seafood that is sustainably harvested shrinks by over a billion kilograms.
To keep these foods from disappearing completely, farmers and scientists have been working together to breed crops that are more resilient in drought and changing weather conditions. (4) If we don't stop climate change, the world may soon lose some of its most important foods.
