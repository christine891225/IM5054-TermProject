The first successful heart transplant operation in the world was carried out in December 1967. From that time until the present day, the only accepted way to preserve a donor heart has been to pack it in ice inside a cooler box. (1) The existing system is that donor hearts are transported in their cool boxes between hospitals by the speediest means possible. (2) The problems of this are obvious; traffic jams, bad weather, or mechanical difficulties can cause such serious delays that the heart may not arrive in time. Additionally, a heart can be damaged when it's warmed up at the end of the surgery. The time constraint means that the heart can't be tested to see if it works until after the transplant operation. (3) The psychological effect on the recipient, and the surgical team, can be traumatic. But, according to pediatric heart surgeon Dr. Mark Plunkett, all that may soon change. (4) A sterile box is made for this purpose. It is heated, and includes a small device that pumps warm, oxygenated donor blood through the heart the entire time it's in transit. This means that the heart can keep beating outside the donor body for up to 12 hours. The still-beating heart can also be monitored en route to keep it in optimal condition. (5) This should lead to improved immediate and long-term heart function, reduce the risk of organ rejection and thus increase the number of hearts available for transplant.
