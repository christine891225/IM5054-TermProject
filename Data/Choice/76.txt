(A) A new heart-preservation system has been designed which maintains the organ in a warm, beating and functioning physiological state.(B) Even then, the heart will usually only be viable, and capable of being transplanted, for between four to six hours.(C) Statistically, from five percent to seven percent of hearts don't work after they've been transplanted.(D) If there were more time to check the heart before transplantation, some of the donor hearts could be used that would have otherwise been rejected.(E) Depending on geography, this usually means the heart is sent either by road, air, or a combination of the two.(F) An additional benefit of the new system is the ability to more comprehensively assess the heart prior to implantation.
